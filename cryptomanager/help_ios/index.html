        <h3>What is Crypto Manager?</h3>
        <p>
          In Crypto Manager you take on the role of a crypto enthusiast who
          wants to get rich.<br />You have learned about the new currency
          CryptoCoin and want to make big money with it. You can either fight
          your way up through the current market development or get your hands
          dirty by doing your own crypto mining.<br />Will you be able to make
          the big breakthrough?

        <h3>UI explained</h3>
        <h4 id="ui-market">Market View</h4>
        <h5>Top View</h5>
        <p>
          In this view you will find the timer, sale and purchase value at the
          top. The timer counts down from 30, as soon as it is at 0, the value
          of the CryptoCoin will be randomly recalculated. the value is then
          displayed at sell. the purchase value is always 5% more than the sale
          value. The sales value progression is also shown again in the diagram.
          A maximum of 20 values are displayed here. Under the chart, the
          available money and cryptocoins are displayed.
        </p>
        <h5>Bottom View</h5>
        <p>
          Here you can initially sell or buy cryptocoins. In the later game, you
          can buy helpers in the store, which are then displayed here. The
          helpers and other store items will be discussed in more detail at a
          later point in this guide.
        </p>
        <h5>Navigation</h5>
        <p>
          In the navigation you can access the store on the left and the
          settings on the right. In the middle you can manually mine
          cryptocoins. The effectiveness is described again in the equipment
          part.
        </p>

        <h4 id="ui-shop">Shop</h4>
        <h5>Top View</h5>
        <p>
          You will find information about your money, your current energy costs
          and your current intelligence value.
        </p>
        <h5>Bottom View</h5>
        <p>
          You can find here all the items that are available for purchase. more
          detailed information about the products can be found in the Equipment
          section. If products can be bought several times, the price per
          purchase always increases by 40%. The sales value is 20% less than the
          purchase value.
        </p>

        <h4 id="ui-settings">Settings</h4>
        <h5>Top View</h5>
        <p>
          A timer is displayed that shows you the current game duration. this
          timer is also displayed again when you have completed the game, so
          that you know how long it took you.
        </p>
        <h5>Bottom View</h5>
        <p>
          You can reset your game once here if you want to start over. In
          addition, there is a query whether you want to rate the game (not
          mandatory), donate one of the predefined values to the developer or
          display the help page. At the point of donation, you get another popup
          where you can select the value and must then confirm it again. You do
          not get any benefits for this donation.
